# Election-Audit Summary
A little time invested into customizing the script can provide on-demand analysis for years to come. By modifying the script, we can disclose other critical data as well. For example, for federal elections we can use the same script and change the county to states to determine the percentages of votes in each state. Also, we can modify the script to dive deeper and determine what percentage of each county voted for each candidate.

In short, no matter how many candidates, counties or state are involved in the elections, this script used for Election Audit can be used and thus is very valuable for the Election Commission.
